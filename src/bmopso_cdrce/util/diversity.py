    """Calculate the crowding distance according to Santana et al. (2009).

    This metric computes the semi-perimeter of the normalized bounding hypercube
    surrounding each non-dominated solution in objective space (Deb et al., 2002).

    Rather than pairwise Euclidean distance, crowding distance measures the size
    of the "empty box" delimited by nearest neighbors in each objective dimension:

        CD(i) = sum_{m=1}^{M} [ (f_m(i + 1) - f_m(i - 1)) / (f_m_max - f_m_min) ]

    Properties:
    1. For each objective m, solutions are sorted and the distance between adjacent
       neighbors (i+1 and i-1) is normalized by the objective range (f_max - f_min).
    2. The linear sum across all M objectives corresponds to the semi-perimeter of the
       bounding hypercube enclosing the solution without containing any other point.
    3. Boundary solutions at the extreme ends receive infinite distance (np.inf) to
       guarantee their preservation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : np.ndarray
        Objective matrix of non-dominated solutions of shape (N, n_obj).

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        1D array containing the crowding distance of each solution.
